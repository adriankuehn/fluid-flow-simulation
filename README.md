# fluid-flow-simulation
Development of a graphical software for the calculation of the drag coefficient by  means of a fluid flow simulation around a scanned 3D body and comparison to the actual results of a  self-deployed wind tunnel

General Summary and Introduction from paper
Some nice screenshots from paper

Instructions for local deployment:

See Screenshot
Run Programm in python Idle, Pycharm does not support tkinter, for deployment in pycharm you need to add tk.mainloop()

addd plus new proprojects, add parameters and then run => red line is cw-value (drag coefficient), remember that in screenshot cw-value is not contstant because of vortoice drag behind body, only at beginning when flow is straight, see instruction in code in line 300
